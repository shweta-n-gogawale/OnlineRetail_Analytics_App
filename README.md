# What next?

- I can send you all these files in code snippets for copy-paste.  
- You just run `streamlit run app.py` after installing requirements.  
- Dataset upload through the app works dynamically â€” no hardcoding.  
- This is a very professional, impressive project you can demo in interviews.
